## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What parameters must users provide when requesting image generation? ‚Üí A: Users select a model, then provide a prompt for that specific model
- Q: What type of "model" are users creating? ‚Üí A: AI-generated custom model/influencer based on user description and reference selection
- Q: How is a model created? ‚Üí A: User describes their ideal model/influencer concept, selects a reference from catalog, system generates the custom model using AI (costs credits)
- Q: Can models be refined after creation? ‚Üí A: Yes, users can refine/improve models through additional prompting iterations (each refinement costs credits)
- Q: How should credit cost be calculated per image generation? ‚Üí A: Variable cost based on both model complexity and prompt/output requirements
- Q: What concurrency limits should apply to generation jobs? ‚Üí A: Plan-based limits (e.g., Free: 0, Basic: 1, Pro: 3, Enterprise: 10)
- Q: How long should generated images be retained in storage? ‚Üí A: 90 days from generation date
- Q: When a subscription expires while a job is processing, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Allow job to complete, deduct credits, but block new jobs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a team member with an active subscription, I want to create custom AI-generated models/influencers by describing my concept and selecting a reference from a catalog, then generate realistic images using those models with text prompts. I should be able to refine my models to make them better. All operations (model creation, refinement, image generation) consume credits. The system should manage my requests in a queue, deduct credits appropriately, and notify me when operations complete.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Model Creation & Management
1. **Given** an authenticated team member with sufficient credits, **When** they create a new model by providing a description and selecting a reference model from the catalog, **Then** an AI generation job is queued, credits are reserved, and they receive a model creation job ID
2. **Given** a model creation job, **When** it completes successfully, **Then** credits are deducted, the custom model is saved, and it becomes available for image generation and refinement
3. **Given** a user has created models, **When** they view their models list, **Then** they see all their custom models with status and metadata
4. **Given** a user with an existing model and sufficient credits, **When** they submit a refinement request with improvement prompts, **Then** a refinement job is queued, credits are reserved, and they receive a job ID
5. **Given** a model refinement job, **When** it completes successfully, **Then** credits are deducted and the model is updated with improved characteristics

#### Image Generation
6. **Given** a user with sufficient credits and a ready model, **When** they submit an image generation request with a prompt for that model, **Then** the request is queued, credits are reserved, and they receive a job ID
7. **Given** a queued generation job, **When** the job completes successfully, **Then** the credits are deducted, the image is stored, and the user can retrieve it
8. **Given** a user with insufficient credits, **When** they attempt any operation (model creation/refinement/image generation), **Then** the request is rejected with a clear error message
9. **Given** any job in progress, **When** the user checks the job status, **Then** they see the current state (queued, processing, completed, or failed)
10. **Given** a failed job (model/image), **When** the failure occurs, **Then** reserved credits are refunded and the user is notified of the failure reason

#### Credit & Subscription Management
11. **Given** a user on any plan, **When** they check their credit balance, **Then** they see available credits, reserved credits, and plan allocation
12. **Given** a user on a paid plan, **When** their subscription renews, **Then** their credits are replenished according to their plan

### Edge Cases
- **Subscription expiry during processing**: In-progress jobs complete and deduct credits; new job submissions are blocked
- **Concurrent requests from same user**: Limited by plan-based concurrency limits; additional requests queue
- **External AI service unavailable**: Jobs remain queued and retry; graceful error handling with user notification
- **Job timeouts**: No timeout constraints configured; jobs run until completion or failure
- **Plan downgrade mid-cycle**: Downgrade takes effect at end of billing cycle; current credits remain until monthly reset
- **Credit exhaustion protection**: Credit reservation at queue time prevents overcommitment; insufficient credits block submission
