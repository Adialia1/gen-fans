## Core Principles

### Component-Based Architecture
Every feature starts as a reusable component; Components must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only components. Focus on media processing components for image and video generation workflows.

### API-First Approach
Every service exposes functionality via RESTful API; JSON protocol for requests/responses with consistent error handling; Support for batch operations and status tracking for long-running generation tasks.

### Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. All image/video generation features must have test coverage before release, including output quality validation.

### Integration Testing
Focus areas requiring integration tests: Media generation workflows, Payment processing integration, User authentication flows, Stripe billing cycles, Third-party API integrations for media processing, User content management.

### Observability and Media Processing
Structured logging required for all generation tasks; Performance monitoring of media processing pipelines; Resource utilization tracking for video/image generation; MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Start simple, YAGNI principles.

## Additional Constraints
Technology stack requirements including Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Stripe; Compliance standards for user-generated content including privacy and data protection; Deployment policies for media processing applications; GPU resource management requirements.

## Development Workflow
Code review requirements for all pull requests; Testing gates requiring all tests to pass before merging, including media output validation; Manual approval process for generation algorithm changes; Performance benchmarks validation for media processing components.

## Governance
All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Media generation quality standards must be maintained; Use development guidance for runtime development guidance.
